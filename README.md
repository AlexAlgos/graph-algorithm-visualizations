# Graph Algorithm Visualizations

Welcome to Graph Algorithm Visualizations! I built this application because I want to see how the algorithms I've learned differentiate visually and to help my classmates learning as well. I hope you enjoy spending time learning about the different graph algorithms through the visualizations! You can access the visualizations here:

Note: Preferably best to access the website using Google Chrome.

## About the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Breadth-first Search**: Is a traversal or search algorithm that works on unweighted graphs. The algorithm also guarantees the shortest path.

**Depth-first Search**: Is a traversal or search algorithm that works on unweighted graphs. The algorithm does not guarantee the shortest path.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Is a pathfinding algorithm that works on weighted graphs with only positive edges. The algorithm also guarantees the shortest path.

***A* Search**: Is a pathfinding algorithm that works on weighted graphs with only positive edges. The algorithm uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path faster than the  Dijkstra's Algorithm. The heuristic I use in the application is the manhattan distance.
